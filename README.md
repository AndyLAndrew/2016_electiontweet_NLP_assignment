This is my prior submission for a Computational Social Science assignment involving Natural Language Processing of tweets from the 2016 electoral candidates.

This project uses the following libraries (either installed or pre-installed) in Python 3.9+
	-matplotlib
	-pandas
	-ntlk
	-seaborn
	-math
	-string

There are answers to questions given in the assignment handout, however I've chosen to not include the handout in order to prevent plagiarism from future CSS students from my college.

This was my first assignment/experience using Natural Language Processing and is what got me hooked on exploring this form of machine learning from then on! I still often use TF-IDF to help me in visualizations for simple term frequency analyses.
